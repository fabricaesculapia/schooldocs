// This is just an example to demonstrate how to create and use Rust code.
// In practice, you would write your own code and maintain it separately.
fn main() {
    // Define a function that does something specific.
    fn print_message(message: &str) {
        println!("{}", message);
    }

    // Call the function with a message argument.
    print_message("Hello, world!");
}
